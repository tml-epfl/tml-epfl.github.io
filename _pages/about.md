This is the page of the Wednesday 4pm seminar of Nicolas Flammarion's group TML.

We try to gather here the precise dates, speakers, presentation materials as well as ideas for next seminars. Topics of interest cover a wide range of theoretical Machine Learning, more precisely and without any precise hierarchy:
======
* The algorithmic regularization of learning or in modern terms implicit bias
* The effect of noise in learning dynamics
* The benign overfitting phenomenon
* Mean-field description of deep-learning dynamics
* Analysis of deep-neural networks function spaces

Going Further
===================
It would be great to maintain a dynamic list of topics that you want to get covered as well as articles that you would like to present. For this email me at etienne[dot]boursier[at]epfl[dot]ch or drop by his office for a chat.
